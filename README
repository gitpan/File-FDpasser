File::FDpasser is a module for passing open filedescriptors between
unrelated processes.  This is Unix Capabable only - if you don't have it -
get it.  Under BSD systems open filedescriptors are passed over Unix Domain
Sockets. Under SysV open filedescriptors are passed over pipes.

If you add stuff for new platforms or fixes send it!
