File::FDpasser is a module for passing open filedescriptors between
unrelated processes.  This is Unix/Unix Capabable only - if you don't have it -
get it.  Under BSD systems open filedescriptors are passed over Unix Domain
Sockets. Under SysV open filedescriptors are passed over pipes.

So far I have only tested the module under Solaris 2.6 and linux 2.2.6 
(upgraded redhat 5.2). It does not yet have support for pre 5.004 stuff -
but I think it isn't needed as I don't recall using any PL_ vars.

OO interface is on the way - it's more a question of a design than
implementing. Ideas welcome.  Doco is scarce at best - patches welcome.

If you add stuff for new platforms or fixes send it!
