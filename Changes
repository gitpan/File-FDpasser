Revision history for Perl extension File::FDpasser.

0.01  Wed Jul 14 12:40:32 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
	Works on Linux and solaris - no OO interface yet
	lots of cleanup needed... alpha stuff... no
	documentation (except the source of course).

0.02  Wed Jul 14 16:40:32 1999
	- Removed stale Data:Dumper references from the
	t/t*.t files.

0.03  Thu Jul 22 10:39:11 1999
	- Fixed t/t10*.t Write on listen fd was being
	queried and some platforms therefore always
	returned true from select when no new client
	was on the other end.

0.04  Tue Jul 27 17:46:17 1999 
        - Changed all socket code to use perl sockets
	and now everything is a Perl Filehandle - perl
	wrappers get the File descriptor - for convenience
	you can give them fd's too.  Only works on Solaris
	so far. bsd43.c support is next.

0.05  Wed Jul 28 02:03:02 1999
        - Added some fixes for Dec unix.

0.06  Thu Jul 29 02:40:07 1999
		- Lots of clean up in the code, loops removed.
	Fixed race conditions in test scripts.  Added bsd43.c
	for (at least) irix.
